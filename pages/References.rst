When we decided to implement scannable walk and call sheets at NationBuilder, we spent a lot of time evaluating different open source solutions.  Initially what drew us to SDAPS was the implementation language, Python, which we were all familiar with, the accessibility of the codebase on Github, and the availability and helpfulness of the maintainer, Benjamin Berg, on IRC.  After working with Benjamin on some changes we needed for our project, we deployed to production.  For October, running up to the end of US elections in November, we were able to process over 22,000 unique contacts, resulting in saving hundreds of hours of volunteer time from inputting and verifying data manually.
