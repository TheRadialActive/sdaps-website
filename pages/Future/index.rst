Ideas for future developments
=============================

If you are interested in helping with any of these developments, then please write to Benjamin Berg or drop by on IRC.

Common questionnaire description format
---------------------------------------

See also `Future/LaTeX`_.

Some people started to work on a description format for questionnaires. Some of the features that you can expect from such a format:

* Versioning information

* Metadata for question layout

* Metadata for data analysis (e.g. hidden variables)

* Translation support

* Automatic survey creation (both online and offline; e.g. SDAPS and limesurvey, but it is not specific to these)

* XML based?

This project is not specific to SDAPS. However a close collaboration is planned so that SDAPS will work with it.

New/Improved LaTeX class
------------------------

There are some shortcomings in the current LaTeX class (i.e. the layout is not flexible enough). There are some ideas for new features and changes:

* Possibility to create LaTeX code from description file (see above)

* Both horizontal and vertical layout of questions

* Single/Multiple answer question types

  * Requires improvements in SDAPS internally

  * Single answer exported as one variable; multiple choice as multiple variables

  * Use circles for single answer and boxes for multiple choice fields (this is a metaphor that is familiar from computers)

* Specifying variable names for the export (requires core changes)

* A "no answer" choice for range questions

* Standardized question type names. i.e. probably recycle the names from limesurvey.

Python 3 Port
-------------

The goal is to port SDAPS to python 3.x in the long run. There are some things that need to happen for this:

* The C module needs to be either ported to the cpython 3 API, or to GLib to use introspection bindings.

* The LibreOffice importer needs to be rewritten using python-uno.

* The OpenCV based package ("convert", import of other image formats and camera image deskewing) requires python 3 bindings to become available.
