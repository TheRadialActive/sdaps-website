The command line interface has been udpated. Some of the commands have changed slightly. But there are also some new features like specifying output filenames.
<!--more-->

The Code-128 style is now the default style when creating new SDAPS projects.

On the TeX front there are two new stared versions of commands:

- \textbox*: A version of the textbox which will not scale in height (as that may cause some problems)
- \checkbox*: A version of the empty checkbox that can be used for examples. Similar to \checkedbox.
