<!--more-->

Important changes:

- Fix the "min coverage" heuristic
- Export text as UTF-8 in CSV files (issue #23)
- report: Ignore empty sheets
- Add "verified" and "recognized" flags for sheets. Recognition will not be done by default if either flag is set.
- GUI: Pressing "Enter" now sets the "verified" flag
- LaTeX class: Paint inner area of boxes white. This is required to allow background coloring.
- Do not ship python-pdftools anymore. It needs to be installed separately now.

And a couple more small bugfixes and additions.

New and updated translations:

- German
- Dutch
