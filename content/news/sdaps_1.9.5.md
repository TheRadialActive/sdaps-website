WARNING: This release breaks compatibility in a number of different ways,
please be careful when upgrading.

The most important change is that the command line argument order has been
changed. The SDAPS command that is to be run is now the first argument, and
the project directory is second.

There have also been a number of changes to the LaTeX class, including new
instruction texts that have not yet been translated to all languages.
