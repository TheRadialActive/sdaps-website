title: Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.2.0
date: 2017-07-16
---
This is a stable release of the new existing unstable series. As the branch
has long been more stable compared to the old "stable" branch this was a
logical step to move forward. Also, most of the development has moved to a
new branch and beta releases will now be published under the "unstable"
series.
