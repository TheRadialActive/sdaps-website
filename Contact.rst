IRC
===

For real time communication you can join our IRC in `#sdaps on freenode`_ (webchat_). Please keep in mind that while IRC is a real time communication system, people may not be around or simply might not have any time to reply immediately.

In general it is a good idea to simply post your request and wait patiently until you get a reply. You can also try to come back at a different time of day as the people who can reply might be living in a different timezone.

Mailing List
============

If you are interested in SDAPS development or usage it is a good idea to join the mailing list. Here you can get help with issues you might be having, discuss improvements to the core software and help with further developments or documentation.
